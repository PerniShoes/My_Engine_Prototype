# My-engine-prototype
Working on a game "engine", learning SDL2
My first bigger project. After finishing it I plan on making few smaller games in it.

### Main goals: 
- Learning C++ and SDL.
#

### Expectations:
- Simple, bug free engine
- Working audio, texture handler, physics engine
- Modular, for generic use
#

### Current state:
- Audio working
- Texture handler close to done
- Physics engine not yet started
#
