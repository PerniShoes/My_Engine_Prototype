# My-engine-prototype
Working on a game engine, while learning SDL2. 
After finishing Pong remake, I will be mainly working on improving the engine, then making a bigger game.
(hopefuly finding a C++ job in the meantime :D)

### Main goals: 
- Learning C++ and SDL2.
- Generic and simple to use, bug free engine with:
- Audio, Textures, simple Physics  (After pong: Proper Physics, Level editor, Sandbox-like capabilities)
- Modular code
#

### Current task list:
Done:
- MouseHandler, Player classes added
- Almost everything for Pong
- Make movement frame independent
- Simple collision checks (all needed for cool Pong)
- Music that adapts to game state
- Various backgrounds
- Added user settings
Pong game remake:
- Some tasks, written down elsewhere
#

### Done:
