# My-engine-prototype
Working on a game engine, while learning SDL2. My first bigger project. 
Right now I am working on Pong game remake inside my engine.
Afterwards, I will be mainly working on improving the engine, then making a bigger game.
(hopefuly finding a C++ job in the meantime :D)

### Main goals: 
- Learning C++ and SDL2.
- Generic and simple to use, bug free engine with:
- Audio, Textures, simple Physics  (After pong: Level editor, Sandbox-like capabilities)
- Modular code
#

### Current task list:
Done:
- MouseHandler, Player classes added
 
Working on Pong game right now:
- Make movement frame independent
- Simple collision checks (all needed for cool Pong)
- Music that adapts to game state
- Animated background based on ball position
#
